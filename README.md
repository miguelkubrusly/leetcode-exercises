# LeetCode Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), implemented as part of my personal coding practice. Each exercise is saved in a separate file, with the filename reflecting the name of the problem. I typically use Python for solving these problems.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-exercises.git
   cd leetcode-exercises
   ```

2. **Find a problem**: Browse through the directories (e.g., `arrays/`, `strings/`, etc.) to find the problem you're interested in.

3. **View the solution**: Each file contains the solution, and at the top of each file, you will find the problem statement commented out for reference.

## Solutions Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Each solution file begins with the problem statement as a comment, so you can easily understand what the task is before diving into the solution.
- **Python Solutions**: The solutions are generally implemented in Python, with straightforward, readable code.
- **In-File Comments**: Code is commented to explain key logic and provide clarity on the approach.

## Running the Solutions

Since the exercises are written in Python, you can run them easily with:

```bash
python3 path/to/exercise_file.py
```

Each file is self-contained, and you can modify or test them further as needed.

## Contributions

This repository is meant for my personal learning and practice. You're welcome to fork it and explore different approaches, but PRs are not being accepted as it's a learning space.

Happy Coding!
